LDLs can cause dangerous blockages in the arteries, reducing oxygen flow to the heart or causing blood clots that can lead to a stroke. The vaccine was able to reduce the bad cholesterol by up to 30% in animal models. It will still be a while before the technology can be used in humans, but it promises a solution that would be more affordable than current options and last around a year per dose.",\n  "url": "https://www.sciencealert.com/a-game-changing-vaccine-could-lower-bad-cholesterol-by-30"\n}',
